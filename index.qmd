Hello! My name is Miles Libbey (he/him), a recent Macalester graduate with pursuits in Data Science, Psychology, Linguistics, and Political Science, passionate about focus on managing databases and transforming raw data into actionable insights. I enjoy working at the intersection of data engineering and analysis, ensuring that information is well-structured, reliable, and ready to reveal meaningful patterns. My most recent project was a outside-of-class Linguistics research with the department chair and a team of many students all from varying disciplines in order to produce a pending article about the dissimilarity of vocalic phonation distinctions across sex and gender. This research is currently being prepared for publication, and it exemplifies my enthusiasm for applying data analysis in new and exciting contexts.

I believe, like the authors of *Freakonomics*, that the world is full of data and questions to be explored, and with the right tools and methods, nearly anything can be delved into. This curiosity is what led me to Data Science in the first placeâ€”its promise of helping to uncover hidden stories within data, whether through cleaning, analysis, or visualization.

I have a long history of working with non-profits, beginning in high school where I completed my goal of getting 168 hours (a week's worth of time) in volunteer work to being a Development Intern at The Arc Minnesota just recently. Ultimately my goal is to hone my data skills so I can go back into the non-profit world and help to create real progress in any way I can.

You can find my CV [here](cv.qmd)
