# About Me

Hello! I am Miles Libbey, a recent Macalester graduate with pursuits in Data Science, Psychology, Linguistics, and Political Science, passionate about focus on managing databases and transforming raw data into actionable insights. I enjoy working at the intersection of data engineering and analysis, ensuring that information is well-structured, reliable, and ready to reveal meaningful patterns. My most recent project was a outside-of-class Linguistics research with the department chair and a team of many students all from varying disciplines in order to produce a pending article about the dissimilarity of vocalic phonation distinctions across sex and gender.

In a Freakonomics way, the world is full of data, and it's fascinating what can be explored (which is just about anything, with the right methods). This was one of the reasons why I had trouble picking a major, but Data Science offered me the ability to keep on exploring and explore in-depth through the gift of how to find reliable data, clean it, and scrutinize it for its stories. 

I have a long history of working with non-profits, beginning in high school where I completed my goal of getting 168 hours (a week's worth of time) in volunteer work to being a Development Intern at The Arc Minnesota just recently. Ultimately my goal is to hone my data skills so I can go back into the non-profit world and help to create real progress in any way I can.
