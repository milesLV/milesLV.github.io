### About Me

::: {#intro-heading}
Hello! I am Miles Libbey V, I am currently a Senior at Macalester College studying Data Science with pursuits in Psychology, Spanish, Linguistics, and Political Science. I am involved with many non-profits in the Bay Area (where I am from) and the Twin Cities, the most recent being The Arc Minnesota, where I am acting as a Development Intern. Outside of work and class, I really enjoy dancingâ€“ so far I am involved with 3 individual dance groups both in school and outside (though, I am definitely still a learner in this field).
