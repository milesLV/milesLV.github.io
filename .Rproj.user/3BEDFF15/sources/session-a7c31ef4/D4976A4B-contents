# About Me

::: {#intro-heading}
Hello! I am Miles Libbey V, I graduated Cum Laude from Macalester College studying Data Science with pursuits in Psychology, Spanish, Linguistics, and Political Science. Not too long ago, I conducted research in Linguistics under the department chair and a team of many students all from varying disciplines. I am also involved with many non-profits in the Bay Area (where I am from) and the Twin Cities, the latest being The Arc Minnesota, where I am acting as a Development Intern. Outside of work, I really enjoy dancingâ€“ at one point I was involved with 3 individual dance groups both in school and outside (though, I am definitely still a learner in this field).
