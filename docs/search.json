    "text": "The Math Behind the App\n\nAdjacency Matrices\nAn adjacency matrix is a type of matrix used to represent a mathematical graph, as pictured below:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe matrix shows which vertices are adjacent to one another and which are not. It can be thought of as this: rows are the starting points and the columns are the ending points. If you can get from a starting point to an ending point, then a 1 is placed, and a 0 is placed if not.\n\\[\nA =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor example, in our graph, 2 and 4 are connected, so if you look in the 2nd row (the starting place) and then look at the 4th row (the ending place), you will see that there is a 1. Vice versa, if you look at \\(A_{2,3}\\) you will see that it is a 0, meaning 2 and 3 are unconnected, which can be confirmed from looking at the graph. These types of matrices are always square \\(n \\times n\\) matrices because it just the same vertices being shown in the both and rows and columns. How this relates to a knight is if you imagine the 64 squares on a chess board as vertices, we can graph the connecting vertices to show what the knight can make in one move (later on we will be able to show multiple moves, but we are not there yet).\nHowever, chess squares have defined places where they are. In this graph, 1 can be put to the right of 4 and it wouldn’t matter, as seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not difference between this graph and the one before, it will have the same adjacency matrix\n\n\n\n\nLattice Adjacency Matrices\nWe need to introduce a system of order to the graph to make it more of a rigid grid. This is precisely why using a Lattice graph is so helpful in this case. Lattice graphs offer distinct coordinates, or lattices, which line up exactly with what we want to do with the chess squares because each squares is distinct and has 2-dimensional coordinates (i.e. the point (1,2) has an x dimension and a y dimension).\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n(1,1) & (1,2) & (1,3) \\\\\n(2,1) & (2,2) & (2,3) \\\\\n(3,1) & (3,2) & (3,3) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\text{Lattice Matrix}\n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\nJust as we made a adjacency matrix out of a normal graph, we can make a lattice adjacency matrix out of a lattice graph. For our purposes, lattice matrices are just regular matrices, but each entry in the matrix is representative of a lattice point (i.e. \\(A_{1,1} \\text{ is representative of the lattice point } (1,1)\\)).\nIn order to make a lattice adjacency matrix given \\(n \\times n\\) lattices, we will essentially construct a \\(n^2 \\times n^2\\) matrix. This comes from exactly what we did with the adjacency matrices; every single node was put across horizontally and vertically in order to have every pairs of connections between the nodes. Just in this case, since our grid has \\(n \\times n = n^2\\) lattices, it will be much larger. Essentially what we’re doing is making a long vector out of the lattice and then making that long vector 2D by taking the outer-product of 2 of long vectors.\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n  4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n  7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\longrightarrow\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 9 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\longrightarrow\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  &1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n  1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\space\\space\\text{Lattice}\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\text{Long Vector}\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\text{2D Long Vector}\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\n\n\nMaking the Lattice Adjacency Matrix\nNow that the matrix is made, we can use the 2D to 1D conversion formula: \\((\\text{row} -1) \\times \\text{row length} + \\text{column}\\). This helps streamline the process of actually assigning what squares are adjacent to one another when a knight jumps. For every single cell, we can just calculate the knight moves with a helper function and then assign them a 1 or 0 if they are adjacent.\nThe end result looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the reason why we wanted to go through all this trouble was because adjacency matrices are very useful for showing future movement from any starting point. This is done as easily as just exponentiating the adjacency matrix \\(A\\) to some degree \\(n\\). In doing so, from the basic properties of matrix multiplication, which we can see clearly using the matrix \\(A\\) from before and making \\(A^2\\) and zooming in on the results of node 2:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{gathered}\n  A =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\\\[1em]\n  A \\times A =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{(0 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1)} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{(1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1)} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{(0 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1)} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{(1 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 1)} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{1} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{2} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{1} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{1} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\\\[1em]\n  \\begin{array}{c c l}\n    \\textbf{Start} & \\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Explanation} \\\\\n    1 & 1 & \\text{1 path from node 1 of } \\textcolor{green}{\\text{length }\\textbf{2}} \\text{ to node 2: } (1 → 4 → 2) \\\\\n    2 & 2 & \\text{2 paths from node 2 of } \\textcolor{green}{\\text{length }\\textbf{2}} \\text{ to node 2: } (2 → 1 → 2), (2 → 4 → 2) \\\\\n    3 & 1 & \\text{1 path from node 3 of } \\textcolor{green}{\\text{length }\\textbf{2}} \\text{ to node 2: } (3 → 4 → 2) \\\\\n    4 & 1 & \\text{1 path from node 4 of } \\textcolor{green}{\\text{length }\\textbf{2}} \\text{ to node 2: } (4 → 1 → 2) \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]"

    "text": "This project was a one of 3 subsets of a larger project done for the Senior Capstone class Projects In Data Science aimed at analyzing SAMHSA’s TEDS-D (Treatment Episodic Data Set-Discharges) 2021 file in seeing how vital quality of life influences– employment status, housing status, and frequency of substance use– changed throughout the time substance abuse facility clients’ stay. This was accomplished from use of 2 time interval variables measuring the same aspect. For example, EMPLOY and EMPLOY_D measured employment at admission and employment at departure respectively.\nSpecifically, this project set out to answer the question, What are the key differences in the characteristics of people whose living arrangements do or do Not change after treatment? In order to provide evidence, it dove into what the composite differences were between those who remained unhoused and those who went from being unhoused to living independently (with a slight interest in looking at those who came in living independently and became unhoused, only 0.6% of clients). This was all done in R, with some use of Python for running models unavailable in R (CatBoost and retreiving the SHAP values of those)."

In this plot, every dot is representative of one case, or one client. The further right a dot is, the higher probability of the client changing from unhoused to house is and vice versa. Since every dot is a single person, those humps are all people, so it is easy to spot that there are many groups in the variables. What is important to see is that there is a trend for these variables to leaning towards the right, with many large humps and tails being there. However, these variables aren’t just univariate and some have good sized humps on the left like in the case of State and Length of Stay. The next model gives insight into which models are more likely to be doing this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Include thank you’s to experts\n\n\nWorks Cited\nBrubaker, Michael D., et al. “Barriers and Supports to Substance Abuse Service Use among Homeless Adults.” Journal of Addictions & Offender Counseling, vol. 34, no. 2, Oct. 2013, pp. 81–98, https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2161-1874.2013.00017.x.

While social media promises connectivity, it often fosters superficial interactions, comparison, and emotional withdrawal. Prior research shows clear links between social media and mental health challenges like anxiety and depression — but much less attention has been paid to whether loneliness itself is becoming normalized and how people are approaching it.\nWe aimed to fill that gap."

    "text": "The Math Behind the App\n\nAdjacency Matrices\nAn adjacency matrix is a type of matrix used to represent a mathematical graph, as pictured below:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe matrix shows which vertices are adjacent to one another and which are not. It can be thought of as this: rows are the starting points and the columns are the ending points. If you can get from a starting point to an ending point, then a 1 is placed, and a 0 is placed if not.\n\\[\nA =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor example, in our graph, 2 and 4 are connected, so if you look in the 2nd row (the starting place) and then look at the 4th row (the ending place), you will see that there is a 1. Vice versa, if you look at \\(A_{2,3}\\) you will see that it is a 0, meaning 2 and 3 are unconnected, which can be confirmed from looking at the graph. These types of matrices are always square \\(n \\times n\\) matrices because it just the same vertices being shown in the both and rows and columns. How this relates to a knight is if you imagine the 64 squares on a chess board as vertices, we can graph the connecting vertices to show what the knight can make in one move (later on we will be able to show multiple moves, but we are not there yet).\nHowever, chess squares have defined places where they are. In this graph, 1 can be put to the right of 4 and it wouldn’t matter, as seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is not difference between this graph and the one before, it will have the same adjacency matrix\n\n\n\n\nLattice Adjacency Matrices\nWe need to introduce a system of order to the graph to make it more of a rigid grid. This is precisely why using a Lattice graph is so helpful in this case. Lattice graphs offer distinct coordinates, or lattices, which line up exactly with what we want to do with the chess squares because each squares is distinct and has 2-dimensional coordinates (i.e. the point (1,2) has an x dimension and a y dimension).\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n(1,1) & (1,2) & (1,3) \\\\\n(2,1) & (2,2) & (2,3) \\\\\n(3,1) & (3,2) & (3,3) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\text{Lattice Matrix}\n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\nJust as we made a adjacency matrix out of a normal graph, we can make a lattice adjacency matrix out of a lattice graph. For our purposes, lattice matrices are just regular matrices, but each entry in the matrix is representative of a lattice point (i.e. \\(A_{1,1} \\text{ is representative of the lattice point } (1,1)\\)).\nIn order to make a lattice adjacency matrix given \\(n \\times n\\) lattices, we will essentially construct a \\(n^2 \\times n^2\\) matrix. This comes from exactly what we did with the adjacency matrices; every single node was put across horizontally and vertically in order to have every pairs of connections between the nodes. Just in this case, since our grid has \\(n \\times n = n^2\\) lattices, it will be much larger. Essentially what we’re doing is making a long vector out of the lattice and then making that long vector 2D by taking the outer-product of 2 of long vectors.\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n  4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n  7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\longrightarrow\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 9 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\longrightarrow\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  &1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n  1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 9 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\space\\space\\text{Lattice}\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\text{Long Vector}\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\text{2D Long Vector}\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space\n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\n\n\nMaking the Lattice Adjacency Matrix\nNow that the matrix is made, we can use the 2D to 1D conversion formula: \\((\\text{row} -1) \\times \\text{row length} + \\text{column}\\). This helps streamline the process of actually assigning what squares are adjacent to one another when a knight jumps. For every single cell, we can just calculate the knight moves with a helper function and then assign them a 1 or 0 if they are adjacent.\nThe end result looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the reason why we wanted to go through all this trouble was because adjacency matrices are very useful for showing future movement from any starting point. This is done as easily as just exponentiating the adjacency matrix \\(A\\) to some degree \\(n\\). In doing so, from the basic properties of matrix multiplication, which we can see clearly using the matrix \\(A\\) from before and making \\(A^2\\) and zooming in on the results of node 2:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{gathered}\n  A =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\\\[1em]\n  A \\times A =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{(0 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1)} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{(1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1)} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{(0 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1)} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{(1 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 1)} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{1} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{2} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{1} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\cdot & \\color{red}{1} & \\cdot & \\cdot \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\\\[1em]\n  \\begin{array}{c c l}\n    \\textbf{Start} & \\textbf{Count} & \\textbf{Explanation} \\\\\n    1 & 1 & \\text{1 path from node 1 of } \\textcolor{green}{\\text{length }\\textbf{2}} \\text{ to node 2: } (1 → 4 → 2) \\\\\n    2 & 2 & \\text{2 paths from node 2 of } \\textcolor{green}{\\text{length }\\textbf{2}} \\text{ to node 2: } (2 → 1 → 2), (2 → 4 → 2) \\\\\n    3 & 1 & \\text{1 path from node 3 of } \\textcolor{green}{\\text{length }\\textbf{2}} \\text{ to node 2: } (3 → 4 → 2) \\\\\n    4 & 1 & \\text{1 path from node 4 of } \\textcolor{green}{\\text{length }\\textbf{2}} \\text{ to node 2: } (4 → 1 → 2) \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\]"
