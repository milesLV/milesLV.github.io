Hello! I am Miles Libbey and this is my portfolio website! Here I have included a little bit about myself and a few of the projects that showcase the tools and skills I have been working with! If you are reading this (for one, thank you for taking your time to do this), then I hope you can get to learn a bit more about me than what is on my resume.
